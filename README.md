# Models and Data reported in Supplementary Information

File types in this data repository:

* .txt: mechanism files
* .dict: dictionary files generated by GraTeLPy and used by `gratelpy_check_data` to translate between your mechanism
         file and GraTeLPy's internal naming scheme for species and reaction nodes.
* .pos: relative x-, and y-coordinates of the nodes of the bipartite digraph --
        used to draw fragments defined by .dot files
* .dat: listings of critical fragments -- some are listed in GraTeLPy's internal naming scheme, some are translated
* .dot: dot files that can be used to draw discovered critical fragments
* .vsg: pickled Python data structures that hold discovered critical fragments (read with cPickle or pickle)
